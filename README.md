# BlockMatrix - also known as OrcClicker

This is a game we built at MachoHacks, where you attack an orc and you can trade with other people via a blockchain, making weapons and items unique, and preserves real ownership, thereby allowing a game to retain scarcity and rarity.

# Functionality
Not functional. It's mostly done, but we're just not 100% done debugging to make it functional. The UI works, just not trading.
